Using Authorize attribute i may specify roles which is allowed to access the resources.
[Authorize(Roles="User")]

But if i have admin user which is allowed to go to any resource i need specify this one as well
[Authorize(Roles="User, Administrator")]

//Authorize entire class
[Authorize]
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
	}
//single action restrictedted to specific role
        [HttpPost]
        [Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
        public ActionResult AdminRoll(FormCollection collection)
        {
		}
