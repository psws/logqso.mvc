A little research turned up a known issue when using jQueryUI and Twitter Bootstrap together. There’s a conflict between jQueryUI and Twitter Bootstrap buttons because they both define $.fn.button().  And as we can see from the jQuery Spinner API docs, our spinner depends on the button element.

A workaround is here:

var btn = $.fn.button.noConflict() // reverts $.fn.button to jqueryui btn
$.fn.btn = btn // assigns bootstrap button functionality to $.fn.btn
Thanks to user fat for posting the workaround code!

noConflict only works if bootstrap.js is loaded after jqueryui.js. 
If bootstrap is loaded first, then the jquery button overrides the function and the noConflict
 is lost (noConflict is not part of the jquery button function). I am using 2.2.2.
