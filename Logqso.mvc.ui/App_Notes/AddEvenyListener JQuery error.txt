Jquery 2.1.1 in IE9 get error: 0x800a01b6 - Microsoft JScript runtime error: Object doesn't support property or method 'addEventListener'

I was getting the same error with a brand new web app in VS2013 Ultimate. Turns out IE11 was running in compatibility mode - turning that off got rid of the error

fix: remove localhost from compatability list in IE11
Removing will break debuging GoogleEarth in localhoat.
