You need to run on the Local IIS Express server to debug
	global.asax  (Application_Start)
	WebActivatorEx  UnityWebActivator.Start()

	If this is in IIS, the app can get started before the debugger has attached.
	 If so, I am not sure if you can thread sleep long enough to get attached.


In Visual Studio, you can attach the debugger to a process. 
You do this by clicking Debug >> Attach to process. Attach to the browser and then hit your application.
 To be safe, then restart IIS and hit the site. I am not 100% convinced this will solve the problem, 
 but it will do much better than firing off a thread sleep in App_Start.

Another option is temporarily host in the built in web server until you finish debugging application start.
