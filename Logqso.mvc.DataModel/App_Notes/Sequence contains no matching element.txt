When you enable cpnfigurations you can get a "Sequence contains no matching element" error.
This is caused by sizing Typename annotations

This line in [Column(TypeName = "decimal(7,4)")]
changing to [Column(TypeName = "decimal")]  fixes this bug

A [Column(TypeName="VARCHAR(254)")] will also generate this error
