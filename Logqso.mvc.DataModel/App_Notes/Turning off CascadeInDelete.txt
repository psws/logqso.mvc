you can often get multiple deletion paths cuz of your Model class relationships.
The best solution is to rearchitect your classes.

The problem is that when you call a delete on the entity, 
it will delete each of the f-key referenced entities as well.

In some cases this is not possible
Example:
Station class has 3 term composite key
LogId is both a PK and a FK toLog table.
The PK is required to all 2 logs to have the same StationName.
The conposite key keeps a log from having dupe StationNames
This is required to allow all Station rows to be associated with a log
When the log is deletedm these rows are cascade deleted
    public class Station
    {
        [Key]
        [Column(Order = 1)]
        public int StationId { get; set; }
        [Key]
        [Column(Order = 2)]
        public int LogId { get; set; }
        [Key]
        [Column(Order = 3,TypeName = "varchar")]
       // [Column(TypeName = "varchar")]
        [MaxLength(20)]
        [Required]
        public string StationName { get; set; }
    }

	The QSO class has a StationName. This is a QSO attribute that identifies which radio made the Q.
	A Multiop Qso needs to know which Log it belongs to. SingleOp have no StationName
	Deletig the log might cause the StatioName to disappear from DB
	We make LogId a foreign key (public Log Log { get; set; }) to prevent log deletion
	without deleting all qsos in the log
	public class Qso
    {
        //http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=386388
        [Key]
        public  int QsoId { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public int LogId { get; set; }
        public Log Log { get; set; }
        //need to turn off CascadeOnDelete on QSO.LogId in LogDataDB.cs
            //https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj591620#RequiredToRequired
            //modelBuilder.Entity<LogData.DataModels.Qso>().HasRequired(p => p.Log)
            //.WithMany().HasForeignKey(c=>c.LogId).WillCascadeOnDelete(false);

        [Column(TypeName = "varchar")]
        [MaxLength(20)]
        public string StationName { get; set; }
        public  int CallsignId { get; set; }
        [DataType(DataType.Date)]
        public  DateTime QsoDateEime { get; set; }
        public  short RxRst { get; set; }
        public  short TxRst { get; set; }

        public virtual CallSign CallSign { get; set; }
    }

	Since LogID is FK, Deleting the Log with this ID will delete this instance of Qso also when cascade delete is pn
	CascadeDelete is on cuz EF defaults to this when the FK qdo.LogOd is required.
	This causes a circular path since Deleting a log will delete all station rows. If 
		You can avoid cascadeDelete by fluentApi in the modelBuilder
        //need to turn off CascadeOnDelete on QSO.LogId in LogDataDB.cs
            //https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj591620#RequiredToRequired
            //modelBuilder.Entity<LogData.DataModels.Qso>().HasRequired(p => p.Log)
            //.WithMany().HasForeignKey(c=>c.LogId).WillCascadeOnDelete(false);

	This is not a good idea, cuz you end up with a QSO wiyj no Log

Multiple Cascading Actions
________________________________________
Individual DELETE or UPDATE statements can start a series of cascading referential actions. 
 example, a database contains three tables: TableA, TableB, and TableC.
  A foreign key in TableB is defined with ON DELETE CASCADE against the primary key in TableA. 
  A foreign key in TableC is defined with ON DELETE CASCADE against the primary key in TableB. 
  If a DELETE statement deletes rows in TableA, the operation also deletes any rows in TableB 
  that have foreign keys matching the deleted primary keys in TableA, and then deletes any rows in TableC
  that have foreign keys that match the deleted primary keys in TableB.

The series of cascading referential actions triggered by a single DELETE or UPDATE must form a tree
 that contains no circular references. No table can appear more than one time in the list of all cascading
 referential actions that result from the DELETE or UPDATE. Also, the tree of cascading referential actions
 must not have more than one path to any specified table. Any branch of the tree is ended when it encounters
 a table for which NO ACTION has been specified or is the default.
