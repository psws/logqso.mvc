In Visual Studio 2012, there is no icon. Instead, there is a 
link in the test results called "Output". If you click on the link, you see all of the writelines.

geez, that "Output" link is intrinsically hard to find. If anyone is struggling to find it, it's in the Text Explorer, bottom section. 
When a test is selected, it shows you the result with "Elapsed time: xxx". Below that is the "Output" link

I think you need to be in debug
