The LogQso.WeApi projec is an example of Controllers in a seperate project from Logqso.mvc.ui presentation layer.
The dat controller and ControlController are located there.

You need to add the Logqso.WebApi project reference to the Logqso.mvc.ui presentation layer
This is required for the WebApi 2 to discover the controllers when the project starts up
